                                   <p class="details" id="details1"> The purpose of women, according to the Quran, is to compliment men. Women’s rights to employment and participation in public life, freedom of movement and freedom of organization, are severely restricted through a combination of the Shari’a principles of qawam (men’s guardianship over women),[8] hijab (the veil) and segregation between men and women. Examples of women’s inequality can be found in the administration of justice and in certain aspects of family law. A woman’s judicial testimony is deemed to be of half the value of that of a man, in civil cases, and is not accepted at all in serious criminal cases.[9] In certain types of wrongful homicide, monetary compensation paid to the heirs of a female victim is less than that paid to the heirs of a male victim and a woman’s share in inheritance is half that of a man’s. Additionally, no woman may hold any public office which involves exercising authority over men.
The status of women in Islam is complicated by the fact that scholarly interpretation of the Qur’an may have been subject to the biases of those who stood to benefit by a society that favored their gender. Women played no part in interpretation of the Qur’an, and their absence “has been mistakenly equated with voiceless ness in the text itself.”[12] Furthermore, social norms in many male-dominated countries may have obscured many of the original purposes of the Qur’anic legislation. Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, claims that the subjugation of women in Islam “has got nothing to do with the religion, but it has got very much to do with material or man-made considerations.”</p>

Muslim marriage has been considered a ceremony for a man to be united with a woman to enjoy their life together and to produce children. Though it can be said that Muslim law in all its egalitarian principles confers upon women equal status is also interpreted in various other ways. Though it was always felt that the man must marry himself to a woman of equal status, there was no such provision for the women that a woman must marry herself to a man of equal status. Rather it was always considered that a man, on marriage with a woman of lower status, would simply elevate her position to his own position. This concept of equality between the two parties to a Muslim marriage was traditionally known as kafa’a. The idea of faskh demonstrates the uncommon platform on which men and women stand in Muslim law. This concept was that a woman who contracts herself to marriage with a man of unequal status without the consent of any of her male relations would render such a marriage violable and rescindable by the Court.</p>

The Qur’anic verse states that “[t]he male shall have the equal of the portion of two females. . . .” Yet a literal reading of the separate verse that specifies heirs’ fractional shares is not consistent in some cases with the double share requirement. For example, if a decedent is survived by his wife and parents, the wife should receive one-fourth of his estate, the mother one-third and the father the remaining five-twelfths. Worrying that the father does not receive double of what the mother receives, the legal scholars determined that the mother was not to receive one-third of the estate but rather one-third of what remains in the estate after the wife receives her share. Under this interpretation, then, the wife would take one-fourth, the mother would take one-fourth also (one-third of the remaining three-fourths), and the father would take the remaining one-half of the estate, thus securing his double portion.</p>

                                   <p class="details" id="details4">In Islamic inheritance law of whether a male always inherits a share that is twice that of a female of equal class presents an interesting case in which male interpreters of the Qur’an may have been willing to stretch even the words of the Qur’an itself to favor their gender. The Qur’anic verse states that “[t]he male shall have the equal of the portion of two females. . . .” Yet a literal reading of the separate verse that specifies heirs’ fractional shares is not consistent in some cases with the double share requirement. For example, if a decedent is survived by his wife and parents, the wife should receive one-fourth of his estate, the mother one-third and the father the remaining five-twelfths. Worrying that the father does not receive double of what the mother receives, the legal scholars determined that the mother was not to receive one-third of the estate but rather one-third of what remains in the estate after the wife receives her share. Under this interpretation, then, the wife would take one-fourth, the mother would take one-fourth also (one-third of the remaining three-fourths), and the father would take the remaining one-half of the estate, thus securing his double portion.</p>

If a mother is unable or unwilling to take custody, the general principle is that a close female relative of hers, .e.g. mother’s mother will take charge of the infant. There are differences of opinion regarding the duration of a mother’s right to custody. The prevailing opinion under the classical Hanafi school is that a mother retains the right of custody until seven years of age if the child is male and until nine years of age if the child is female. And that duration of custody in the Maliki school is the age of puberty in case of a boy and till marriage in case of a girl while in the Hanbali school it is seven years for both boys and girls.
