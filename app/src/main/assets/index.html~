But then Article 28 (4) states: Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making special provisions in favour of women and children or for the advancement of any backward section of citizens.

1. Article 7 of the Constitution declares that any existing law of the state which is inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution shall be void.</br>
2. Articles 27, 28 and 29 of the Constitution declare the principles of non discrimination.</br>
3. As per Articles 36, 39 and 65 of the Constitution, a woman has the right to seek nomination and contest for any political opposition.</br>
4. Article 28(2) of the Constitution states that women shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of STATE and PUBLIC life.</br></p>

                                   <p class="details" id="details3"> There are also constitutional laws that directly discriminate against women. The Citizenship Act of 1951, for example, states that only a man can transmit nationality. A woman does not have the right to transmit her nationality to her children or husband. Strangely this prejudicial law has existed for decades in other parts ofSouth Asia such as India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In 1992 however, the Citizenship Act of India 1955, was amended to allow both men and women equal right to transmit their nationality to their children and spouses. In Bangladesh the Citizenship Act, relegates women to second class citizenship. The Factories Act 1934, The Tea Plantation Labour ordinance 1962 and The Shops and Establishments Act 1965, gravely restrict women's right to movement or choice of employment. These laws prohibit employment of women and children between the hours of 8p.m. and 6a.m.</p>

The Dowry Prohibition Act of 1980 forbids anyone from giving or receiving dowry although the practice is still very prevalent in our country which indicates the lack of enforcement. The “Nari-O- Shishu Nirjatan Daman Ain 2000” (Law on the Suppression of Violence against Women and Children 2000), has for the first time expanded the definition of rape considerably although it does not acknowledge marital rape. Sexual assault and sexual harassment have been made punishable offences under this Act. The overall character of this new law is reflective of same level of participatory effort; the law on children is one of the best examples of the workings of a clear distinction between religion as a private matter and the area of personal welfare of citizens as subject to state intervention. The laws on children and personal disputes relating to children such as the Guardians and Wards Act, the Majority Act and the Child Marriage Restraint Act, are all applied uniformly to all children and citizens of Bangladesh, irrespective of gender or religion despite these areas being clearly within religious-personal sphere of citizen's lives.</p>
